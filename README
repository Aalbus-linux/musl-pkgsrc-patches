This is a collection of patches to pkgsrc for packages to build properly on
musl-based Linux systems.

It can be applied with a tool such as quilt, mq or guilt, or simply
$ cat .../musl-pkgsrc-patches/*.diff | patch -p1

This will probably only work with the expected version of pkgsrc, which is
written in PKGSRC_VERSION.
